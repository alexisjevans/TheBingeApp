# TheBingeApp

## Description

The Binge App was inspired by my personal method of trying to find something good to watch on TV. Anytime I am trying to find something good, I always start with Twitter. The resources I've found on the internet so far to find reviews are pretty boring and general. On twitter, a lot of people live tweet during their favorite TV shows or even just tweet about whatever they happen to be watching. Typically if a show is good, people are tweeting about it. So my theory is that if a certain movie or TV show was tweeted about pretty often, its worth a watch. Of course I actually go through the tweets to see what people are saying, and I do this by actually searching the title or the hashtag that includes the title + streaming service. Most shows on Hulu or Netflix have a hashtag that people use when tweeting, i.e. #InventingAnnaNetflix. So my vision is to create an app that can do that work for us, by accessing Twitter's API. I think most people either love their TV shows, or don't watch much TV but want to watch something worthwhile if they do. So I think the Binge app could be a cool convenience. My current website is a rough draft of what I hope to bring to life in the future.

## Dependencies Used
1) Spring Data JPA
2) H2 Database
3) Spring Web

## Hurdles
 I ran into a lot of hurdles and actually started over a few times. With the backend I decided to go with a simpler approach that I could understand. Angular did give me a pretty hard time. I watched countless and tutorials and videos and it seemed that a lot of the material was for older Angular versions. So I did get a lot of errors and after doing some research, there were some adjustments I had to make in order to to satisfy the latest Angular update.
 
 ## Things I'd Do Differently
 If it were up to me, it would be the coolest website in the world. I just have more to learn so I can execute that. I want to be able to access Twitter's API to search for specific tweets and use that data to populate the reviews.
